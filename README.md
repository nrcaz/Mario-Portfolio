# Mario-Portfolio
A small mario level as an interactive Portfolio

http://nicholas-rossette.epizy.com/mario-portfolio/

This is 100% Vanilla JavaScript without library / framework or game engine / software.

This is the JS project i enjoyed the most, except for the pixel art which was a pain using JS canvas functionalities, i guess it was close to how they did it back in the day, coding pixel by pixel ( didnt do the background tho ... otherwise i wouldnt be here writing this ).

TODO list :
- split JS code into different files
- finish mobile version controls
- fix remaining animations bugs ( when hitting left + right arrow, falling animation )
- add tutorial indications for keyboard controls ???
- try to create moving platform ???
